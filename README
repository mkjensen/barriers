Over time, this project should be a clean-up and further development of an
application originating from a master's thesis that aimed to help biochemists.
The thesis is titled "Energy Landscape Analysis for Peptides using Barrier
Trees." The original text of this README is included below.

Note that the project depends on several libraries and a nontrivial technical
environment. A setup guide and/or a more accessible application should be made
available in the coming months.
