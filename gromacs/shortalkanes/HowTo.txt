What I (caba) have done here:
# Smiles files:
# Ethane.smi:
CC
# Propane.smi
CCC
# Butane.smi
CCCC
# t-Butane.smi ; the first branched alkane
CC(C)C


# Converting smi to pdb, including creating 3d structure and adding Hydrogens
~/Progs/openbabel-2.3.0/bin/bin/obabel -ismi Ethane.smi -o pdb -OEthane.pdb --gen3D

# Prepare top with an old Gromacs version (VERSION 3.3.3)
x2top -f Ethane.pdb -o out.top  -ff oplsaa -v

# does x2top still exist in recent versions of gromacs?
# stupid me: the name was changed to g_x2top
# seems to work too. but still only for the OPLS force field
g_x2top -f Ethane.pdb -o out.top  -ff oplsaa -v

# changing the topology to amber03 is easy:
#	- change the 'include' statement
#	- change the atom types to 'CT' and 'HC'
#	- adopt charge groups (optional)
#	- delete all explictly given parameters
#	- change dihedral angle types to '9'

# For Martin:
# There are four directories with eval scripts 
# (similar to the ones your created)
# the files: 
# caba-optimization.mdp ...	options file for geometry optimization
# caba-shortMD.mdp ...		options file for a short md simulation
# eval ... 			performs geometry optimization
# eval_md ...			performs short MD simulation

# If you installed Gromacs in a non-standard location,
# do you export the GMXLIB variable?
# This is important to make gromacs find the force field parameters.
# Check: first line of 'top' files
