1) Execute prepare path/to/molecule.pdb path/to/topology.top
   to generate files needed for evaluation.
2) Execute evaluate path/to/conformation.pdb (or evaluate_d)
   to calculate the energy value(s).
3) Parse the generated energy file if there are multiple
   energy values or execute energy which prints the line
   containing the potential energy value (it is slow and it
   is only correct if the energy file contains one frame).

Steps 2 and 3 can be repeated multiple times after step 1.

Temporary files and the energy file will be written to the
directory in which the evaluate script is executed. In
Ubuntu, e.g. /dev/shm (RAM) could be used.
