1) Execute minimize path/to/conformation.pdb
   path/to/topology.top (or minimize_d) to minimize.
2) Read the output conformation and/or the energy file
   to work with the minimized result.

Temporary files and the energy file will be written to the
directory in which the minimize script is executed. In
Ubuntu, e.g. /dev/shm (RAM) could be used.
