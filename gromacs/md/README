1) Execute md path/to/conformation.pdb
   path/to/topology.top (or md_d) to perform a molecular
   dynamics simulation.
2) Read and parse the output trajectory and the energy
   file.

Temporary files and the output files will be written to
the directory in which the md script is executed. In
Ubuntu, e.g. /dev/shm (RAM) could be used.
